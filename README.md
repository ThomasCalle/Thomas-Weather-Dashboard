```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Overview

### The Challenge

As a Developer are often we are tasked to with retrieving Third-party API data and implementing it into a 5 day weather forecaast. The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Usign the OpenWeatherMap APIs to retrieve weather data for cities I needed to pass in longitude and latitude coordinates to provide the given city names weather data.
My localStorage has been setup to store the applications persistent data to ensure search history is maintained.
